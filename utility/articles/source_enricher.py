"""Top up a thin source page with material from the pages it links to.

A short page is the one case where writing a script from the source alone forces
the model to invent the difference. A 102 word stub asked to fill a 60 second
video (about 140 spoken words) has to make up most of the script, and for a
historical or political subject that means fabricated detail.

The fix is not to follow every link. Measured on a real stub
(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad_Shah, 102 words, 17 outgoing links):

    Dadshah (film about him)      308 words   names the subject 4 times   useful
    Insurgency in Balochistan    8000 words   names the subject 0 times   drift
    Mohammad Reza Pahlavi        8000 words   names the subject 0 times   drift
    Baloch people                8000 words   names the subject 0 times   drift

Following links blindly would bury 102 relevant words under 24000 irrelevant
ones and quietly change what the video is about. So a linked page is only
accepted when it actually names the subject. That single test keeps the useful
page and rejects all three broad ones.

Enrichment only runs when the main page is too thin to support the video, is
capped at a few pages, and every borrowed sentence is marked with where it came
from so the script generator can treat it as supporting material.
